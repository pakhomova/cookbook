My first full-stack application :)

To run this app, you need to:
  In "server" folder:
  1) Run "npm install" command to install node modules.
  2) Run "docker-compose up" command to run database server.
  3) Run "npm start" command to run server application.
  
  In "cookbook" folder:
  1) Run "npm install" command to install node modules.
  2) Run "npm start" command to run client application.

App will be available on "http://localhost:3000/#/".
